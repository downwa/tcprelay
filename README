I.    WHAT IS TCPRELAY?

It is meant to relay TCP traffic between a server and a client, logging all
exchanged data in between.



II.   WHY TCPRELAY?

Programs like tcpdump, Ethereal and the like make it difficult to simply log
traffic exchanged over TCP between two end points. This program simply
performs a forward between a server and a client and logs it.

The primary purpose is to log the traffic, so as to see what is going on
through an SMTP connection for example.
In addition, as it relays traffic, it allows to do "pass-through" networking
on top of TCP.

The logging of the traffic is done in binary format by default, you can also
get telnet-style logging, assuming the traffic is made of printable lines
(suitable for traffic like SMTP, POP3, etc.)

It provides similar functionalities to tcptunnel, of Clemens Fuchslocher,

III.  LICENCE

See COPYING file that comes along with the package the program belongs to.



IV.   COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION

- Linux

The file of name INSTALL, distributed with tcprelay source files, gives
instructions to compile and install the program, using the usual
    ./configure
    make
    make install
sequence.
This INSTALL file is the one provided by default by autotools.

- Windows

You have to install Mingw and run
    mingw32-make.exe -f makefile.gcc
Mingw is licensed under GPL mostly (as of beginning of 2012), its homepage is
    http://www.mingw.org

Borland was not tested, neither Visual C++. If ever used, one showstopper to
fix will be the getopt library, used to parse long options.

Mingw makefile generation

    There is no need to recreate makefile.gcc, if ever you wish to do it any
    way, you have to install Bakefile and run the batch
        gen-win-makefile.cmd
    Bakefile is a system allowing multi-platforms control of compilation, you
    can find it here:
        http://www.bakefile.org



V.    TRAFFIC SPELLING

It takes two 'f' in English, one in French.
Yes.
